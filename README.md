# Adaptive-deprivation-EU-SILC
The aim of this project is to show how adaptive deprivation scales can be applied in the context of a measure which is being implemented across multiple countries with very contrasting levels of poverty and deprivation. Adaptiave scales aim to collect data from survey respondents in much less time and with minimal loss of information. Specifically we examine how this approach would perform in relation to the EU's new child deprivation scale using data from the EU-SILC. 

This work builds on an earlier project which first showed how adaptive deprivation scales could be successfully deployed in the context of a single country, the UK. Code for that work is available here: https://github.com/nick-bailey/Adaptive-deprivation-measure. Results were published in the journal 'Social Indicators Research' (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-020-02283-1 - open access). 

## Outputs
The work has been accepted for publication by the journal 'Child Indicators Research' (May 2022). A pre-print is available on SocArxiv (https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mvqnf - open access)

## Data
Data for the EU-SILC were obtained under licence from Eurostat for this specific project.  

## Files
Dataset preparation and analysis was done using R (R Core Team, 2013) with packages ‘dplyr’ (Wickham et al 2019), ‘tidyverse’ (Wickham 2017), and ‘ltm’ (Rizopoulos 2006) current at May 2022.
